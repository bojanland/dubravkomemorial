# dubravkomemorial
Memorial Website for Dubravko Landekic

My dad was Dubravko and he cared greately for me. I neglected him in the last 10-20 years of his life and want to make up for that by building a memorial site as he died almost 20 years ago.  I will gather information that I need, pictures, maybe even a video.  It will be the means to remember him.  I might even write a poem.
